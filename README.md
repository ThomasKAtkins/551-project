# Data Deliverables:

* Denis
  * Aligned file of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from the United States
  * For each position, a metric of how frequently that residue mutates (potentially Shannon entropy?)
* Masha
  * For each position in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence, a numeric score for how much that reside binds to ACE2
* Thomas
  * For each position in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence, a score for how common it is for HLA to bind to that residue
